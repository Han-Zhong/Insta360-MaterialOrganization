## 📏 使用方法

1. This project is exclusively established for academic purposes, aiming to facilitate communication and learning. It is not intended for deployment in production environments.
2. Any sovits-based video posted to a video platform must clearly specify in the introduction the input source vocals and audio used for the voice changer conversion, e.g., if you use someone else's video/audio and convert it by separating the vocals as the input source, you must give a clear link to the original video or music; if you use your own vocals or a voice synthesized by another voice synthesis engine as the input source, you must also state this in your introduction.
3. You are solely responsible for any infringement issues caused by the input source and all consequences. When using other commercial vocal synthesis software as an input source, please ensure that you comply with the regulations of that software, noting that the regulations of many vocal synthesis engines explicitly state that they cannot be used to convert input sources!
4. Engaging in illegal activities, as well as religious and political activities, is strictly prohibited when using this project. The project developers vehemently oppose the aforementioned activities. If you disagree with this provision, the usage of the project is prohibited.
5. If you continue to use the program, you will be deemed to have agreed to the terms and conditions set forth in README and README has discouraged you and is not responsible for any subsequent problems.
6. If you intend to employ this project for any other purposes, kindly contact and inform the maintainers of this repository in advance.
